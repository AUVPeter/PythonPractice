# PythonPractice
Some tutorials and best practices for using Python at AMSL.

These represent the most common things I do with Python, and by no means represent the only way to do them.
They are simply the methods that I have found to provide a good balance between:

- Speed, efficiency and scalability with growing data
- Clarity, a big mantry for Python code is that it should be somewhat self-documenting and the intentions are clear
- Availability, choosing methods and libraries that are generally available and not requiring the inclusion of many third parties. the libraries used here come with Anaconda,or are part of the standard QGIS python
